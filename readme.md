# Competence - An Open-Source Discord Bot Template

A side project of mine, following my questionable love for Discord bot development.

**Competence** is an open-source, self-hostable Discord bot that is entirely free. Written using `pycord` - a maintained fork of `discord.py`, this bot utilises features such as cogs which allows for a modularised and scalable project.

**Please note that this project is still in the early stages. Not all features are guaranteed to work as intended.** Competence is based on my previous projects [MÃ¥tta](https://github.com/luqmanually/matta), and it's [Legacy](https://github.com/luqmanually/matta-legacy) version.

## Features

Competence is designed to be feature-rich.

### Dashboard

Competence's web-based localhost Dashboard, based on HTML and CSS, allows user-friendly and easy customisation and setup of the bot.

The bot has an asynchronously running flask-based backend, which allows the dashboard to communicate with the bot.

### Maximum Customisability

Customise anything and everything you want. **Enable/Disable** any commands you want, and more.
